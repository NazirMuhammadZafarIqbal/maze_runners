  Project Plan
</h2>
<p>
  Our project is going to be a 2D game about the labyrinth. Each of the levels is going to be randomly generated and the player has to find the way out of it. At the start of the game, there is going to be a menu where you can exit or start the game. The platform we chose is PC. Keyboard controls are used to play the game and there is an award for finishing the game within a time limit.

  Contribution to the project
</h2>
<ul>
  Create a new branch from the develop branch with your own ID and continuosly merge changes with the develop branch.
  The develop branch is merged with the main branch once all deadline goals are met or prior deadline dates (these are specified by the course this project is made for).
  
  If you are using a custom IDE make sure to exclude the configuration files by extending the .gitignore file found in the root directory.
