Our project is going to be a 2D game about the labyrinth. Each of the levels is going to be randomly generated and the player has to find the way out of it. At the start of the game, there is going to be a menu where you can exit or start the game. The platform we chose is PC. Keyboard controls are used to play the game and there is an award for finishing the game within a time limit.
